You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 \"Ghostrick\" Xyz Monster you control; Special Summon 1 \"Ghostrick\" Xyz Monster from your Extra Deck with a different name from that target, by using that target as material. (This is treated as an Xyz Summon. Transfer that target's materials to the Summoned monster.) You can only use this effect of \"Ghostrick Reform\" once per turn.",
