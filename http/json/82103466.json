If this card attacks an opponent's monster, during the Damage Step only, negate the effects of that monster while it is face-up on the field (but its effects can still be activated), also its ATK becomes half its original ATK. Once per battle, if this card battles, during damage calculation (Quick Effect): You can make this card's ATK become equal to the highest original ATK on the field (your choice, if tied).",
