If this card on the field would be destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect, you can send 1 other card you control to the GY instead. You can send 1 Level 3 monster from your Deck to the GY, then target 1 \"Burning Abyss\" monster on the field; it gains ATK/DEF equal to the sent monster's ATK/DEF, until the end of this turn. You can only use this effect of \"Cherubini, Black Angel of the Burning Abyss\" once per turn.",
