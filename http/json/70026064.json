(This Special Summon is treated as an Xyz Summon. Xyz Materials attached to it also become Xyz Materials on the Summoned monster.)\n\nMonster Effect\nImprisoned after a showdown with \"Bujin Hirume\" over the Sky Throne, this master schemer eventually escaped by manipulating Hirume and creating the sinister \"Bujinki Amaterasu\", then went on to almost engulf the world in darkness, but was finally defeated by Yamato and his allies.",
