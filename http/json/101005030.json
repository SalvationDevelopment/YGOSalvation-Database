While this Ritual Summoned card is on the field, your Ritual Monsters cannot be destroyed by battle. If this card was Ritual Summoned using only Ritual Monsters, you do not pay LP to activate its effects. Once per turn: You can pay 2000 LP; destroy as many other cards on the field as possible, and if you do, inflict 200 damage to your opponent for each card on their field destroyed by this effect.",
