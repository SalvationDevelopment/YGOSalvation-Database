If this card is Normal Summoned: Target up to 3 cards you control, except this card; shuffle those targets into your Deck, then discard as many random cards from your opponent's hand as possible, but not more than the number of returned cards, and if you do, this card gains 1000 ATK for each card discarded by this effect.",
