When your &#x201C;F.A.&#x201D; monster whose Level is at least 5 higher than its original Level battles an opponent's monster and inflicts battle damage to them: banish 1 card from your hand, field or GY. You can only activate this effect of &#x201C;F.A. Winners&#x201D; once per turn. If 3 of your &#x201C;F.A&#x201D; Field Spells with different names are currently banished, and were all banished by the effect of &#x201C;F.A. Winners&#x201D;, you win the Duel.",
