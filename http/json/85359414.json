While equipped to a monster by this card's effect, each time the equipped monster inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent, destroy 1 face-down Spell or Trap Card on the field. (1 monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster is destroyed as a result of battle, destroy this card instead.)",
