While equipped by this effect, the equipped monster loses 500 ATK and DEF. If the equipped monster destroys an opponent's monster by battle: Destroy all face-up monsters on the field with the same Monster Type as the destroyed monster. (A monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster would be destroyed, destroy this card instead.)",
