(Xyz Materials attached to that monster also become Xyz Materials on this card.) This card gains DEF equal to the combined Ranks of all Xyz Monsters you control x 200. While this card has Xyz Material, each time your opponent activates a Spell/Trap Card, inflict 600 damage to your opponent immediately after it resolves. Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card; destroy all face-up monsters your opponent controls with DEF less than or equal to this card's.",
